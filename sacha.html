        <h2 class="speaker-name">A talk by Sacha Judd</h2>
        <h1>The Good Internet: How Fandom Can Reclaim the Web</h1>
        <h2>The Topic</h2>
        <p>Ever miss the days when the internet felt like a wild frontier of fan-made magic, weird little websites, and
          pure creativity? Sacha does too. In this spirited talk, she traces the internet's roots in fan culture—from
          the scrappy communities that wrote epic fanfiction and built personal sites in the '90s, to today's social
          media giants who seem more interested in selling your data than sharing your joy.</p>
        <p>By exploring the heart and soul of fandom, Sacha shows us how we can escape the algorithmic doom loops and
          reclaim our digital lives. She'll champion small, personal, independent spaces where your online presence is
          truly yours. From building your own site to discovering (and creating!) small games, art, fanfiction, memes
          and fun little passion projects, her message is simple: embrace the DIY ethic that once made the web a home
          for boundless curiosity and creativity.</p>
        <p>If you're fed up with corporate walled gardens and hungry for a more authentic online experience, join
          Sacha's journey to bring back the “good internet” - a place fueled by genuine community, creativity, and
          connection. It's time to roll our sleeves up, rebuild, and rediscover the thrill of finding your people in the
          digital wild. The power's in our hands - let's use it.</p>

        <h2>The Person</h2>
        <p>My first computer was a Commodore Vic 20, aged ten. I was one of the first home users of the internet in
          Aotearoa/New Zealand in 1993, much to the chagrin of my parents who didn't enjoy paying astronomical rates for
          dial-up for me to hang out in LambaMOO. My first fandom was The X-Files, and I've lived and breathed
          transformative fan communities ever since. They're the best (and sometimes the worst!) of the internet. Now
          I'm weirdly micro-famous for giving tech talks all over the world about Harry Styles.</p>
