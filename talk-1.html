      We shouldn't be building "the web" - a monolith, a monoculture - but better webs. Indie webs. Small
      webs. Solar-powered webs. Poetic webs. All undergirded by healthy roots/infrastructure and
      interlinked, interconnected and interoperable.

    <dt>Origin Story</dt>
    <dd>I completed the installation of the NTL dial-up on our family computer the first time we had access
      to the internet. It was only putting a CD into the computer and following a wizard but I remember how
      incredibly novel it felt! The internet timed out every 20 minutes and I mostly played games at that
      point, but I have been extremely online ever since.
